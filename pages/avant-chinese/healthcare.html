<p>Health care coverage — including coronavirus testing for people who need it — should be affordable for all Californians.<br> </p>



<p>All patients with full-service Medi-Cal or commercial insurance in California will have copays, coinsurance and deductibles waived for COVID-19 testing and screening.</p>



<p>If you don’t have health care coverage or recently lost employer-sponsored health care coverage, see the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/img/CoverageOptionsFactSheet.pdf">Health Care Coverage Options Factsheet (pdf)</a> to get covered.</p>



<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Should I use cloth face coverings or masks to protect against COVID-19?</strong></strong></p>


-->
<p>Yes,&nbsp; when you must leave home to conduct essential activities you should use cloth face covering.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Face-Coverings-Guidance.aspx">California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Released a Guidance on Use of Cloth Face Coverings.</a></p>


<!--
<p>The cloth face coverings recommended are <strong>not </strong>medical grade respirators, such as N95 and surgical masks.</p>



<p>The guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Staying at home and physical distancing&nbsp;</li><li>Washing hands frequently</li><li>Avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li><li>Avoiding being around people with COVID-19 symptoms</li></ul>



<p>The use of cloth face coverings could reduce the transmission of COVID-19 by individuals who do not have symptoms and may reinforce physical distancing.</p>



<p><strong>What is a cloth face covering?</strong></p>



<p>A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>



<p><strong>How should I care for a cloth face covering?</strong></p>



<p>It’s a good idea to wash your cloth face covering frequently, ideally after each use, or at least daily. Have a bag or bin to keep cloth face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your cloth face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard cloth face coverings that:</p>



<ul><li>No longer cover the nose and mouth</li><li>Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps</li><li>Cannot stay on the face</li><li>Have holes or tears in the fabric</li></ul>



<p><strong>What if I don’t have health insurance and I need screening or treatment for COVID-19?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Check with your local <a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/">community health center</a> or hospital to see if fees for testing can be waived</li><li>See if you’re eligible for <a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/Pages/DoYouQualifyForMedi-Cal.aspx">Medi-Cal</a></li><li>See if you’re eligible for <a href="https://www.coveredca.com/">Covered California</a></li></ul>



<p><strong>I want to get screened or tested for COVID-19. I have insurance, but what will this cost me out-of-pocket?</strong></p>



<p>It should be free. The state agencies that regulate health care in California have mandated that all full-service insurance plans (including Medi-Cal) waive copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles for medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19. This includes emergency room, urgent care, or provider office visits when the purpose of the visit is to be screened and tested for COVID-19.</p>



<p><strong>I have mild COVID-19 symptoms. How long do I have to isolate at home?</strong></p>



<p>Follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">ending self-isolation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>I am nervous or scared. What can I do?</strong></p>



<p>You are not alone. The California Surgeon General released <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/manage-stress-for-health/#top">two playbooks for managing stress</a> and tips for care-givers and kids. If you feel like you need to talk to someone and want emotional support see this <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/resources-for-emotional-support-and-well-being/#top">list of resources</a>.</p>



<p><strong>My safety net eligibility (like CalFresh, Medi-Cal) is expiring and I am under the statewide shelter in place order for COVID-19. Do I need to renew my eligibility now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>No, you will not need to renew for 90 days.</strong> Governor Gavin Newsom issued an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/18/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-ongoing-safety-net-services-for-most-vulnerable-californians-during-covid-19-outbreak/">executive order</a> to ensure that health care, food assistance, and in-home supportive services continue during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>



<p>The order waives eligibility re-determinations for 90 days for participants in:</p>


-->
<ul><li>Medi-Cal health coverage</li><li>CalFresh food assistance</li><li>CalWORKs</li><li>Cash Assistance for Immigrants</li><li>In-Home Supportive Services</li></ul>



<p><strong>I have a concern or complaint about getting care for COVID-19 under my health insurance. What can I do?</strong></p>



<p>If you are having trouble accessing care, or were inappropriately charged cost-sharing for medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19, follow up directly with your health plan by calling the member phone number listed on your health plan card. If your health plan doesn&#8217;t resolve the issue, contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.HealthHelp.ca.gov">California Department of Managed Health </a><a href="https://github.com/cagov/covid19/issues/www.HealthHelp.ca.gov">Care</a>&nbsp;(DMHC) Help Center for assistance at 1-888-466-2219.</p>

<p><strong>How can I keep up to date on the latest scientific research on COVID-19?</strong></p>



<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has compiled the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov">latest global research on COVID-19</a>.</p>



<p><strong>How are doctors and health care providers keeping patients safe?</strong></p>



<p>The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released guidance for health care providers. See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Guidance.aspx">CDPH Guidance Documents</a> for details.</p>
