<p>If you’re an immigrant living in California, here is what you need to know to protect yourself, your family, and your community from coronavirus. Services and public benefits are available to you, some regardless of immigration status. And special assistance for immigrant Californians who don’t qualify for other programs will be available in May.</p>



<h2>Testing and treatment</h2>



<p><strong>Don’t let fear stop you from getting necessary treatment</strong>, as the effects of avoiding health care services may be very serious. This will help keep you, your family, and your community healthy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you are undocumented and/or don’t have insurance, you can get necessary testing and treatment for COVID-19 through Medi-Cal emergency services, even at a local clinic. Medi-Cal care for COVID-19 related testing or treatment does not count under the public charge rule because it is the treatment of an emergency medical condition.</p>

<h2>Disaster Relief Assistance for Immigrants&nbsp;</h2>



<p>On April 15, Governor Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/15/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-support-california-workers-impacted-by-covid-19/">announced</a> one-time disaster relief assistance for undocumented Californians impacted by COVID-19, who are ineligible for most other forms of pandemic assistance, including direct assistance under the CARES Act and unemployment insurance.</p>



<p>Eligible Californians may receive one-time COVID-19 disaster relief assistance at a value of $500. A limit of two adults per household can receive this assistance (maximum assistance of $1,000 per household).</p>



<p>The CA Department of Social Services (CDSS) will select immigrant-serving community-based nonprofit organizations to conduct targeted outreach, application assistance, and delivery of the disaster relief assistance to eligible individuals. The selected organizations will deliver the assistance directly to qualified individuals. CDSS’ goal is for Californians to be able to access this relief through local community-based nonprofits starting mid-May 2020. A final date will be provided in the coming week.</p>
