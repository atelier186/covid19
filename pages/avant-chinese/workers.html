<h2>Unemployment insurance</h2>



<p>The state has removed waiting periods for unemployment and disability insurance for Californians who lose work as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>



<p>Starting April 12, California workers who are receiving unemployment insurance (UI) benefits began receiving an additional $600 per week.</p>



<h2>Help for self employed and independent contractors</h2>



<p>Starting April 28, the state will be rolling out a new program to help unemployed or partially unemployed Californians who are business owners, self-employed, independent contractors, and others who are financially impacted by the pandemic. This is a federally funded program called the <a href="https://edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/coronavirus-2019/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.htm">Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program</a>. The PUA benefits will be available if you don’t qualify for regular UI benefits in California or another state, and also don’t qualify for State Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits. PUA benefits <a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Labor-Secretary-Letter-04.14.20.pdf">will be issued within 24-48 hours</a>, not the traditional 21 days ​for regular UI claims.</p>

<h2>Hotel rooms for California healthcare workers&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Non-Congregate Sheltering (NCS) for California Healthcare Workers Program was created to keep California&#8217;s healthcare workers safe and healthy and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. It provides hotel rooms to healthcare workers who give critical care to COVID-19 patients so they don’t bring home the virus to their household.&nbsp; Once they leave their shift, they can stay near their healthcare facility at a participating hotel for free or at a discount.&nbsp;</p>
