<p>Each county and local government in California is working along with the state to protect people experiencing homelessness during COVID-19 and prevent others from losing their homes during the outbreak.</p>



<h4><strong>People experiencing homelessness</strong></h4>



<p>Individuals and families experiencing homelessness can contact their local homeless <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/coc_poc.pdf">Continuum of Care</a> and follow this <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/flowchart-COVID19-homelessness.pdf">recommended protocol</a>. In many communities, they can also call 211 for assistance. </p>



<p>County governments are responsible for placing individuals in hotel and motel rooms through <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/FEMA/Project-Roomkey-Fact-Sheet.pdf">Project Roomkey</a> and the state’s new partnership with Motel 6.</p>



<h4><strong>Emergency shelters (including hotels and motels)</strong></h4>



<p>Homeless Assistance Providers should coordinate with their local homeless <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/coc_poc.pdf">Continuum of Care</a>, County Office of Emergency Management Contacts, County Social Services agencies, tribes, and other partners, to determine their community’s need for hotel/motel rooms to accommodate homeless individuals and families and request support from the state.</p>



<p>The Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council has created some <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/covid19_funding_faqs.pdf">frequently asked questions for Homeless Assistance Providers</a> around the $100 million emergency funding.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></strong></h3>



<p><strong>I am homeless and I may have come in contact with coronavirus. How can I self-isolate with nowhere to go and services closing down?</strong></p>



<p>Motel and hotel rooms may be available for families and individuals experiencing homelessness who have been exposed to COVID-19.<a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/coc_poc.pdf"> Contact</a> your local homeless Continuum of Care to connect you to this service.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be a rent freeze or waiver for renters? Will evictions be allowed during the stay at home order?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, there is an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/16/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-renters-and-homeowners-during-covid-19-pandemic/">order</a> in place to halt evictions and protect renters. If you are financially impacted by COVID-19 and <a href="https://bcsh.ca.gov/coronavirus19/graphic_rent.pdf">can’t pay your full rent</a>, make sure to let your landlord know in writing within seven days of the rent coming due, and save documentation as proof. The order does not relieve a tenant from the obligation to pay rent, or restrict the landlord’s ability to recover rent that is due.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Can landlords delay their payments while tenants might be suffering from COVID-19 and cannot pay rent?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Yes, there are protections in effect through May 31, 2020 for landlords.
