<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>Should I use cloth face coverings or masks to protect against COVID-19?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes,&nbsp; when you must leave home to conduct essential activities you should use cloth face covering.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Face-Coverings-Guidance.aspx">California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Released a Guidance on Use of Cloth Face Coverings.</a></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The cloth face coverings recommended are <strong>not </strong>medical grade respirators, such as N95 and surgical masks.</p>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Staying at home and physical distancing&nbsp;</li><li>Washing hands frequently</li><li>Avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li><li>Avoiding being around people with COVID-19 symptoms</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The use of cloth face coverings could reduce the transmission of COVID-19 by individuals who do not have symptoms and may reinforce physical distancing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What is a cloth face covering?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">H<strong>ow should I care for a cloth face covering?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s a good idea to wash your cloth face covering frequently, ideally after each use, or at least daily. Have a bag or bin to keep cloth face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your cloth face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard cloth face coverings that:</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>I want to get screened or tested for COVID-19. I have insurance, but what will this cost me out-of-pocket?</strong></h4>
